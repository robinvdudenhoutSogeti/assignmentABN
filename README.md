# Recipe Application

### Description project
This is a REST API in which recipes can be to shown, created, updated and deleted.

Besides, being able to handle the Happy flows the application also has custom exceptions handlers.

### Technologies 
Technologies that I have used were: Java 11, Spring Boot, Jupiter, Mockito,
ModelMapper, Swagger, SwaggerUI and MySQLConnector.

I have used MySQLConnector to use a MySQL database. I have the most experience working 
with MySQL database, so I chose this one for convenience.

Spring Boot was chosen since it make developing REST API's easier with variables like GetMapping.
With a standard Spring Boot project a template for unit testing is also generated which was handy for this project
since unit tests were required.

ModelMapper was chosen to make it easier to transform a DTO object to an entity object and vice versa.

### Code coverage
Because of the time I was not able to get a code coverage of 80% but I made it close with 75%.
